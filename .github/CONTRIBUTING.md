  branching model.
- Follow good practices when writing Git commit messages. In short:

    50\. If that is not possible, Keep it at a maximum of 50 characters and add
    any additional information into the message body.
  - Message body must be separated from the subject line by a blank line and
    wrapped at 72 characters.
  - Subject line must begin with a capital letter.
  - Use imperative mode for the subject line.
  - Subject line must not end with a period.
